Recursive function:

1.Recursion uses selection structure.
2.Infinite recursion occurs if the recursion step does not reduce the problem in a manner that converges on some condition 
(base case) and Infinite recursion can crash the system.
3.Recursion terminates when a base case is recognized.
4.Recursion is usually slower than iteration due to the overhead of maintaining the stack.
5.Recursion uses more memory than iteration.
6.Recursion makes the code smaller.

Iteration function:

1.Iteration uses repetition structure.
2.An infinite loop occurs with iteration if the loop condition test never becomes false and
  Infinite looping uses CPU cycles repeatedly.
3.An iteration terminates when the loop condition fails.
4.An iteration does not use the stack so it's faster than recursion.
5.Iteration consumes less memory.
6.Iteration makes the code longer.
